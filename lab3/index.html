					<h2>My Difficulties!</h2>
					<p>Man this lab was definetly the most difficult to figure out so far. My partner and I would find the smallest mistakes, like forgetting a ";" or a dash. D; Pain. But also it was very fun to figure it out and everything was fine in the end. Anyway, I learned that its really all in the details.</p>

					<h3>The Results</h3>
						<p>As a result of this lab, I felt like I learned a lot! I definetly have a sense of growth with navigating Atom which makes me feel proud of myself:) Also, I feel like I bonded with my parter over issues within our code and getting to solve them together!</p>
