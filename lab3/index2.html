				<h1>Get to know me!</h1>
				<p>Hello! I am Kyra. I go by she/her pronouns and I am an Environmental Studies and Sustainability minor. I am just taking this class for funs and so far I have been really enjoying it! I like to do art on the side of school. Usually I like to doodle, paint, or use procreate, but recently I have been getting into bleach painting on clothes and making 2D animations. I also love music and want to somehow combine my art passion with music and environmentalism. Not sure how yet but I will figure it out. Otherwise, I am a very active person and enjoy traveling, hikes, walks, and ocean dips. Hope you have a good day:)</p>
