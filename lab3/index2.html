	<h1>Get to know me!</h1>
	<p>Hello! I am Kyra. I go by she/her pronouns and I am an Environmental Studies and Sustainability minor. I am taking this class for fun and it has been really interesting so far! I do art on the side of school, bleach painting on clothes, doodling, and I am trying to get better at 2D animation. I also love music and want to somehow combine my art passion with music and environmentalism somehow. Not sure how yet but I will figure it out. Otherwise, I am a very active person and enjoy hikes, walks, and ocean dips.</p>
