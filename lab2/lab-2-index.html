	<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	<p>Hi. This is Kyra and Keiko.


	<p> Hi Keiko. My name is Kyra! I am 21 years old from Los Angeles. I enjoy being active, learning new things, trying new things, camping, surfing, hanging with friends, anything that I can make myself busy with. During my self care, down time I like to draw or eat good snacks from Trader Joes and 7/11. Yup! I am excited for this class, I have never taken a coding class before but this has been fun! Looking forward to getting to know you! Have a good day:)</p>


	<p> Nice to meet you, Kyra! I'm Keiko. I'm 19 and from LA, too! Around the NELA area. Like you, I'm super active. I've played basketball my whole life and I love going to the gym. I recently began bouldering, which has been a fun new challenge.
