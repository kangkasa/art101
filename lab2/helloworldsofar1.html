	Hi Keiko. My name is Kyra! I am 21 years old from Los Angeles. I enjoy being active, learning new things, trying new things, camping, surfing, hanging with friends, anything that I can make myself busy with. During my self care, down time I like to draw or eat good snacks from Trader Joes and 7/11. Yup! I am excited for this class, I have never taken a coding class before but this has been fun! Looking forward to getting to know you! Have a good day:)

	Nice to meet you, Kyra! I'm Keiko. I'm 19 and from LA, too! Around the NELA area. Like you, I'm super active. I've played basketball my whole life and I love going to the gym. I recently began bouldering, which has been a fun new challenge and I've been slacklining since last year. I used to go camping a lot as a kid, I wonder what ur fav spots are! I'm a casual artist (doodles, painting, poetry/prose) and love reading. This is my first coding class too, but it's going well and I'm excited to get into things! Hope ur well! See you around✿
